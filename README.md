# aiki-player
The idea of this player is to provide additional information to the exam preparation videos. 

[Open the player](https://anick107.github.io/aiki-player/docs/aiki-player.html)

## Status
This is a proof-of-concept version which is not even properly tested. The concept itself has a huge room for improvement, e.g.:
 * search function
 * url friendly navigation
 * comfy clip tagging interface (with autocomplete)
 * and so much more.

## Disclaimer

Extention of the clips database (clips.json) is much appreciated. Just pull request.

PS: I know, jquery is not cool anymore. If you can do better, just do it ;-) Any help is welcome.
